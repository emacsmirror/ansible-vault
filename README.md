# ansible-vault-mode

Minor mode for in place manipulation of [ansible-vault][ansible-vault].

## Installation

You can install via ELPA:

```
M-x package-install RET ansible-vault RET
```

Or manually downloading `ansible-vault-mode` and adding the following lines to
your conf files:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ansible-vault")
(require 'ansible-vault)
```

## Usage

Once `ansible-vault-mode` in installed you will need to do a little
configuring before it is useful.

First you will need to set up your ansible-vault password file. By default
`ansible-vault-mode` assumes the file is located at `~/.vault-pass`. Either
put your password there or customize the mode to change the location.

You will want to make sure that file has the mode `0600` so other people
cannot read it.

```bash
$ ls -al ~/.vault-pass
-rw------- 1 notroot notroot 33 May 18 16:11 /home/notroot/.vault-pass
```

Once that is set up we can start using `ansible-vault` normally.

The majority of my [ansible-vault][ansible-vault] files are called `encrypted`
and are [YAML][yaml] files so I have the following snippet to turn on ansible vault
when needed.

```lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("/encrypted$" . yaml-mode))

(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (and (string= (file-name-base) "encrypted") (ansible-vault-mode 1))))
```

The ```*ansible-vault-error*``` buffer will contain any errors from ansible-vault execution.


### Automatic enabling based on file contents

To enable `ansible-vault-mode` just based on the buffer contents, not on file extension, you can do:

```
  (defun ansible-vault-mode-maybe ()
    (when (ansible-vault--is-vault-file)
      (ansible-vault-mode 1)))

  (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook 'ansible-vault-mode-maybe)
```

And if you use the handy `use-package` package replace the last line with:

```
  (use-package ansible-vault
    :init (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook 'ansible-vault-mode-maybe))
```

### Per directory ansible-vault password file

To override ansible-vault password file on a per directory basis:
first, create a `.dir-locals.el` file in your directory:

```lisp
((yaml-mode
  (ansible-vault-password-file . "/home/notroot/.ansible-vault/custom_vault_pass")))
```
then, if all your vaulted files are prefixed by "vault_", you can load
ansible-vault-mode in your init file this way:

```lisp
(add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook
          (lambda ()
            (when (and
                   (derived-mode-p 'yaml-mode)
                   (string-prefix-p "vault_" (file-name-base)))
              (ansible-vault-mode 1))))
```
